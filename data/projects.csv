luna-y-dos-soles-transit-plaza-and-figueroa-anacapa-blocks-,Luna Y Dos Soles (Transit Plaza and Figueroa/Anacapa Blocks),"Together, these two blocks not only provide downtown housing but provide a sense of arrival for bus passengers and revitalize the transit center with integrated bus, bicycle and ride share options.  A network of paseos, walkways, open space and parks is created, and fosters interaction with casual entertainment and food options.  The buildings use sustainable design and take advantage of subterranean parking.

The Luna Block (Chapala Transit Plaza) provides an opportunity as a gateway to the downtown State Street promenade.  The crescent-shaped turn-in off Chapala Street for the buses provides the inspiration for new curved and tiered buildings overlooking the park as well as the name of the project.  It provides 10 off-street bus parking spaces, 135 housing units on upper floors, a revamped transit center office, neighborhood grocery store, commercial/art gallery space on the first floor and subterranean parking below grade.   A park in the center of the block is looped by a pedestrian walkway with bollards that can be removed for temporary service vehicles.  Removing one storefront on State Street creates a direct pedestrian path through the site to the Transit Center.  While State Street's facade is largely maintained for its unique characteristics, more housing units were added behind the existing structures overlooking the new park.

The Dos Soles Block (Figueroa and Anacapa Block) provides an opportunity as a passageway to Santa Barbara Court House.  The block is currently occupied by banks and commercial buildings, many of which are historically significant.  The corner of Figueroa and Anacapa is remade with a 4-story mixed use building,  86 housing units on upper floors and subterranean parking below grade.  Surface parking in the middle of the block is replaced with a food truck oriented park in the center for people-watching, live music and open space during lunch and dinner hours.

The goal of the 400 Block is to create a vibrant and green space for residents and visitors alike. To provide commercial and residential mixed use, while preserving its historical landmarks and making room for innovations and art of the future. The main challenges faced in this block are the lack of residential space, access to open spaces, pedestrian safety, and dynamic commercial uses. To change this, our team re imagined the 400 block with the following changes: 

 

1.    Closure of State Street in the 400 Block for all non- emergency vehicles. 

2.    Conversion and preservation of the Historic Savoy Theater for residential use.

3.    Green Roofs/ Terrace and courtyards for addition of open space. 

4.    Paseos and alleyways connecting the courtyards through State Street to Haley, Chapala, Anacapa and Gutierrez.  

5.    Redevelopment of the 99 Only Store and the adjacent surface parking lots into housing.

6.

makers-block-500-project-overview,Makers' Block (500) - Project Overview,"We feel the best bet for creating long term economic and cultural sustainability downtown, has as much to do with redefining the commercial use of this area as it does with adding more housing units. Although it is critically important to resolve our housing crisis, in order to successfully prepare for the unknown challenges we will face in next 20, 50 or 100 years, we must also develop the means to support and sustain livelihoods at the local level.
Our solution is to offer an experience more deeply engaged in process and product. Affordable housing is only one half of the equation. Santa Barbara must also invest in the type of workforce that the community wants to be part of. Housing and livelihood must go hand in hand. To address this need, we propose turning the 500 block into an area dedicated to cohesive community growth - ultimately becoming a resilient and productive live/work environment.

To achieve this, we need to ensure that the right mixture of uses will get developed; ones capable of providing an even driving force for both economic and cultural stability. Examples are:

-Workforce housing

-Digital fabrication & software engineering

-Light manufacturing

-Daycare

-Food production commissary kitchen
